Swift is a new programming language to write iOS, OS X, watchOS, tvOS apps, without the constraints of C compatibility. Swift is an open source and it supports playgrounds, where you can experiment with Swift code and see the results immediately, without the need of building and running an app. By using playground you can focus on code and core concepts. 

In Swift a line of code like below is a complete program. 

{% highlight swift %}
print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}

You don't need to import a separate library for functionality. You also don't need a main() function. You also don't need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.
