While doing programming you need to use variables to store various information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory. There are different types of data types depending on what type of information you may want to store. 

Use **let** to make a constant and **var** to make a variable. 

### Declaring Variables:

{% highlight swift %}
var name: type = value
{% endhighlight %}

### Declaring Constants:

{% highlight swift %}
let name: type = value
{% endhighlight %}
